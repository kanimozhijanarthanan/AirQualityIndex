## Introduction
Air pollution is a critical environmental issue. This project leverages a dataset containing information about air quality indicators such as particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and other environmental variables like wind speed, humidity, and temperature. The analysis categorizes air quality using the AQI (Air Quality Index) and its types (e.g., Good, Satisfactory, Poor, Moderate).

## Features
- **Data Import**: Load and inspect the dataset for quality analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensure no missing or inconsistent values in the dataset.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots to analyze trends and distributions.
- **Categorization**: Identify AQI types across different states and cities.
- **Insight Generation**: Provide actionable insights about air quality trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Web Scraping: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`
  - Visualization: `plotly`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AirQualityIndex.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AirQualityIndex
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook AirQualityIndex.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells step-by-step to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
   - Visualize key insights.

## Results
The analysis highlights:
- Variations in air quality across different regions.
- Correlations between pollutants and environmental factors.
- Categorization of AQI types (e.g., Good, Satisfactory).

Example visualizations include:
- Bar charts showing AQI distribution by state and city.
- Heatmaps of pollutant concentrations.
- Line graphs for temporal trends.
